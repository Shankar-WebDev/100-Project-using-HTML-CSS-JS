          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
          content and structure of web content.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
          SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2

          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

          Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and
          for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the
          server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the
          page is sent to the user's web browser.

          React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
          applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only
          concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
          React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
          client-side functionality.
